/// We will aim to detect 2 things, RUN[] (memory run data) and Mem* (start of data)
/// 
/// That should be all that is required.  After we initialize these 2 values the next order of operations,
/// in the case of Windows we can brute force the debug block
/// and do a symbol lookup of the in-memory GUID to find the offset into the patch guard ^ keys so we 
/// can do a decodepointer to give us the DEBUGGER data for pretty much * symbols.
/// 
/// Adding DMP will also give us the ability to do a faster dev cycle since we'll be able to simply bring up
/// an equivalent analysis in windbg to see if our interpretation is accurate.
